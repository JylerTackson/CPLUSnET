# What is a Tensor?

A **tensor** is a mathematical object that generalizes scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions. It is a multi-dimensional array that can represent data or relationships in various dimensions.

## Key Properties:

1. **Rank**: The number of dimensions (or axes) of the tensor.

   - **Scalar**:

     - Rank 0
     - 0 Axis
     - 0 Dimensional Tensor

   - **Vector**:

     - Rank 1
     - 1 Axis
     - 1 Dimensional Tensor

   - **Matrix**:

     - Rank 2
     - 2 Axis
     - 2 Dimensional Tensor

   - **Higher-dimensional arrays**:
     - Rank 3 or more
     - 3 or more Axis
     - 3 or more Dimensional Tensor

2. **Shape**: The size of the tensor along each dimension.

   - X, Y, Z for Three dimensions

3. **Data Type**: The type of data stored in the tensor (e.g., integers, floats).
   - Inside the arrays there will just be _Data Type_ Scalars stored so we need to maximize storage and runtime by minimizing wasted storage.
   - Probably be using doubles or flats but they use a plethora of data types in the PyTORCH library.
