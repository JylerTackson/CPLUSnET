/**
 * @file MasterClass.h
 * @brief This file contains the definition of the MasterClass, which serves as the central
 *        class for the entire project. It acts as the foundational component that other
 *        classes and modules within the project depend on or extend from.
 *
 *        The MasterClass is designed to provide core functionality, shared resources,
 *        and a unified interface for managing and coordinating the behavior of other
 *        classes in the system. It ensures consistency and acts as the backbone of the
 *        project's architecture.
 *
 *        All other files in this project either directly or indirectly interact with
 *        this class, making it the master class that governs the overall structure
 *        and flow of the application.
 *
 * @note Modifications to this file may have a significant impact on the entire project.
 *       Ensure thorough testing and validation when making changes.
